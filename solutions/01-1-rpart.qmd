A "full" call to rpart with (most) relevant hyperparameters

```{r rpart-example-1}
rpart_penguins <- rpart(
  formula = species ~ flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g,
  data = penguins_train, # Train data
  method = "class", # Grow a classification tree (don't change this)
  cp = 0.03, # Complexity parameter for regularization (default = 0.01)
  minsplit = 15, # Number of obs to keep in node to continue splitting, default = 20
  minbucket = 2, # Number of obs to keep in terminal/leaf nodes, default is minsplit/3
  maxdepth = 15 # Maximum tree depth, default (and upper limit for rpart!) = 30
)

# Evaluate
penguins_test$rpart_predicted_species <- rpart_predictions
# Confusion matrix
table(penguins_test$species, penguins_test$rpart_predicted_species)
# Accuracy
mean(penguins_test$species == penguins_test$rpart_predicted_species)
```

Not much else to show here, just play around with the parameters!
