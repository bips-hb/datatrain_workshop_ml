The idea would be to re-run this code chunk with different hyperparameters:

```{r example-rr-rpart}
rr <- resample(
  task = spam_task, 
  # Important: set predict_type to "prob", set other parameters as desired.
  learner = lrn("classif.rpart", predict_type = "prob", maxdepth = 15, cp = 0.003),
  resampling = rsmp("cv", folds = 3)
)

rr$score(msr("classif.acc"))[, .(classif.acc)]
```

ROC curve based on resampling iterations:

```{r rr-rpart-roc}
autoplot(rr, type = "roc")
rr$aggregate(msr("classif.auc"))
```

Alternatives to ROC:
Precision-Recall curve (prc) and a threshold-error curve --- all three can be very useful depending on your specific classification problem!

```{r knn-roc}
autoplot(rr, type = "prc")

# Threshold plot doesn't work on resampling result, but on prediction objects!
autoplot(rr$prediction(), type = "threshold")
```
