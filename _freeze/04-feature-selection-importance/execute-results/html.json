Introduce feature selection\n2. Introduce (some) variable importance measures\n3. Compare measures for different settings\n\n# Feature Selection\n\nThere is a lot more to cover than we have time for here, see e.g.:\n\n- [mlr3gallery post with example](https://mlr-org.com/gallery/optimization/2020-09-14-mlr3fselect-basic/index.html)\n- [mlr3book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/chapters/chapter6/feature_selection.html)\n\nSelecting features with `{mlr3}` is similar to parameter tuning: We need to set\na budget (e.g. 20 evaluations like before) and a criterion (like the AUC.)\nwith a resampling strategy (here holdout for simplicity).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfselect_instance = fsi(\n  task = spam_task,\n  learner = lrn(\"classif.rpart\", predict_type = \"prob\"),\n  resampling = rsmp(\"holdout\"),\n  measure = msr(\"classif.auc\"),\n  terminator = trm(\"evals\", n_evals = 20)\n)\n\nfselect_instance\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n<FSelectInstanceBatchSingleCrit>\n* State:  Not optimized\n* Objective: <ObjectiveFSelectBatch:classif.rpart_on_spam>\n* Terminator: <TerminatorEvals>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are multiple feature selection methods available:\n- Random Search (`FSelectorRandomSearch`)\n- Exhaustive Search (`FSelectorExhaustiveSearch`)\n- Sequential Search (`FSelectorSequential`)\n- Recursive Feature Elimination (`FSelectorRFE`)\n- Design Points (`FSelectorDesignPoints`)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmlr_fselectors\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n<DictionaryFSelector> with 8 stored values\nKeys: design_points, exhaustive_search, genetic_search, random_search,\n  rfe, rfecv, sequential, shadow_variable_search\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you might be able to imagine, doing an exhaustive search is not often feasible \nwhen we're working with a lot of features. For a dataset with 10 features, \nexamining every possible subset of  features would yield over 1000 models to evaluate. \nYou can imagine how feasible that approach would be for genome-wide studies with thousands of variables.\n\nRandom search it is, then!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfselector <- fs(\"random_search\")\n\nfselector$optimize(fselect_instance)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output

Feature Importance\n\nInterpretability is a huge topic, and there's a lot to explore - we'll cover some basics and if you're interested, you can always find more at\n\n- The [`{iml}` package](https://christophm.github.io/iml/articles/intro.html)\n- The [Interpretable Machine Learning book](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book)\n- The [`{mlr3}` book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/interpretation.html)\n\nBefore we get started with the general methods, it should be noted that some learners bring their own method-specific importance measures.\nRandom Forests (via `{ranger}`) for example has some built-in importance\nmetrics, like the corrected Gini impurity:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlrn_ranger <- lrn(\"classif.ranger\", importance = \"impurity_corrected\")\nlrn_ranger$train(penguin_task)\n\nsort(lrn_ranger$importance(), decreasing = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   bill_length_mm flipper_length_mm     bill_depth_mm            island \n      54.12837595       36.56900939       28.81896524       22.64844773 \n      body_mass_g               sex              year \n      22.07387914        0.70907768       -0.06248512 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich shows us that for our penguins, `bill_length_mm` is probably the most relevant feature, whereas `body_mass_g` does not turn out to be as important\nwith regard to species classification.\n\n\n## Feature Importance with `{iml}`\n\nWe can to the same (or a similar) thing with a general approach provided by the `{iml}` package, which lets us analyze any given learner wrapped by `{mlr3}` (and many other models created outside `mlr3`).\n\nIt has a similar object-oriented approach as `{mlr3}` with a `Predictor` object\nwe create using our learner and our data, separately for predictors and target:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlrn_ranger <- lrn(\"classif.ranger\", predict_type = \"prob\")\nlrn_ranger$train(penguin_task)\n\n# Get dataset of predictors only\npenguin_x <- penguins[, names(penguins) != \"species\"]\n\n# Assemble Predictor\npredictor_rf <- Predictor$new(lrn_ranger, data = penguin_x, y = penguins$species)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then create a `FeatureImp` object for our importance values:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguin_importance <- FeatureImp$new(predictor_rf, loss = \"ce\")\n\nplot(penguin_importance)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04-feature-selection-importance_files/figure-html/iml-importance-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis type of feature importance is based on permutation, i.e. how much the prediction\nerror changes after a feature was randomly shuffled. \nIt's not the same approach as the one we saw with ranger, but it's model-agnostic,\nmeaning it can be applied to any method.\n\nIn some cases, different methods may disagree.  \nAs an example, let's look at the Bikesharing dataset.  \nThis dataset contains data on the number of bike rentals over an extended period of time --- see also `?mlr3data::bike_sharing`.  \nSince this is a regression problem, we switch to `regr.ranger` as our learner:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbikeshare <- tsk(\"bike_sharing\")\n\n# Since it's a relatively large task and some of these methods take some time, we downsample the dataset by 50% --- feel free to comment this out at home when you have the time, or reduce it even further if it's still too slow.\nbikeshare$filter(partition(bikeshare, 0.5)$train)\n\n# Remove variables of unsupported types (for iml Predictor)\nbikeshare$set_col_roles(c(\"date\", \"working_day\", \"holiday\"), remove_from = \"feature\")\n\n# Ranger: Built-in Gini impurity\nlrn_ranger <- lrn(\"regr.ranger\", importance = \"impurity_corrected\")\n\nlrn_ranger$train(bikeshare)\n\nsort(lrn_ranger$importance(), decreasing = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                hour
