# Data Train: Introduction to Machine Learning

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is the workshop component to the [Machine Learning workshop in the Data Train
2025 series](https://www.bremen-research.de/data-train/courses/course-details?event_id=114).

The repository contains [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) `.qmd` notebooks for hands-on ML demos & exercises.  
Example code for exercises is included but "hidden", and only visible on the website after you unhide it.

See the [workshop website](https://bips-hb.github.io/datatrain_workshop_ml/index.html) for materials and setup instructions.

## Further Reading

### Code examples

We rely on the mlr3 framework and its free online book for the hands-on part of the workshop:

### Free Lectures (online with slides + videos)

Lecture materials take inspiration from these free and open-source lectures:

- Introduction to Machine Learning ("I2ML"): https://slds-lmu.github.io/i2ml
- Interpretable Machine Learning: https://slds-lmu.github.io/iml
