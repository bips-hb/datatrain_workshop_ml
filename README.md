# Workshop: Data Train Intro to ML

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Workshop component to the Machine Learning workshop in the Data Train
2021 series.

Repository contains Rmd notebooks for hands-on ML exercises.

## Agenda (WIP)

1.  KNN (`{kknn}`) classification w/ `{mlr3}` basics
    -   Setting up tasks and learners
    -   Training and predicting once and with resampling (CV)
    -   Realizing how KNN works pretty well for this kind of problem
2.  Trees: Single trees via `{rpart}`, many trees via `{ranger}`
    -   Benchmarking both algorithms
    -   Maybe tuning for `{rpart}`?
3.  Boosting maybe?
